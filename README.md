# Code-Alpha
This repository contains the projects I completed during my first internship at CodeAlpha, where I developed my Java programming skills. The internship ran from August 15, 2024, to September 15, 2024.  Completed Tasks:
Student Grade Tracker System: A Java program that allows a teacher to input students' grades and calculate the average, highest, and lowest scores using arrays.
Hotel Management System: A Java application for managing hotel operations, including room bookings, check-ins, check-outs, and tracking reservations.
